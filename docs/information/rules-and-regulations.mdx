## Chapter 1.00.0 - Basic Rules & Policies

### 1.00.0 INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

Thank you for taking the time to review and educate yourself on the rules and guidelines of the Venture Roleplay Gaming Grand Theft Auto 5 Roleplay server. Rules are a very important part of this operation for many reasons; one of which is to keep everything operating as organized and efficiently as possible. This guide will explain the specific server’s specific rules/guidelines as well as the punishments offered as a consequence of breaking these rules.

### 1.01.0 KNOWLEDGE OF CONTENTS

It will be the responsibility of every member to have knowledge of all policies, rules, guidelines, and punishments. Every member will be held accountable for such knowledge. Once inducted into the community, the member will be held accountable for all actions committed. It will be assumed that the member has basic knowledge and awareness of these rules upon their entry into the community.

### 1.02.0 SPAMMING

Spamming of any kind in text and/or voice chat will not be tolerated. This includes, and is not limited to continuous loud noises, a mass number of nonsense messages, repetitive microphone muting/unmuting, etc. This rule applies to ALL chat platforms under Venture Roleplay Gaming.

### 1.02.1 VOICE CHAT

Voice chat spamming is also prohibited. This means actions such as muting and unmuting the microphone, unnecessary loud noises, and any other noises that may be deemed annoying to a listener’s ears are completely prohibited. &#x20;

### 1.02.2 TEXT CHAT

Spamming in text chats would be defined as a mass, in some cases unnecessary, posting of messages in any chat platforms hosted by Venture Roleplay Gaming. Sending tagged messages to ping another member repeatedly is also prohibited, and will be considered spamming upon sight.

### 1.03.0 ADVERTISING

Advertising of any other server, regardless of the game platform, or server type, will not be tolerated in this community. One is prohibited from even speaking of other servers in community platforms. If one wishes to send a server IP other than Venture Roleplay Gaming, they will have to directly message the IP to the recipient.&#x20;

### 1.03.1 CLASSIFICATION

Advertising is defined by Venture RoleplayGaming as informing the members of the community of another’s server’s presence. One is required to not speak about other servers anywhere within the community. Spreading other server’s IPs throughout the community is a prime example of advertising.

### 1.03.2 ENUMERATING

Mentioning the name of another community within Venture Roleplay Gaming is not allowed. One is prohibited from promoting the server name throughout the community. One may only mention another server name if asked to do so by a member of authority, or when they are not promoting the server.

### 1.03.3 SHARING IPs

Giving out IPs of other servers is not permitted under any circumstance.&#x20;

Whether it be shared publicly or privately, it is not allowed whatsoever.

### 1.04.0 MORALE

All members are expected to act with respect and an exceptional attitude towards others and the community. There shall be no racial, religious, gender, age, and/or nationality motivated disputes whatsoever. This server is a hub for people with a common interest to gather and converse. Failure to meet the expectations of this rule will disrupt community peace - which then results in punishment for the offender. Disrespect towards staff will not be tolerated whatsoever.

### 1.04.1 RESPECT

All members are to act with respect towards everyone within the community. All members are to behave within parameters and follow given instructions and rules when instructed to do so. All members shall show utmost respect to staff members as well as normal members.

### 1.04.2 ATTITUDE

All members shall embrace the policy of acting in good attitude. This is to prevent disputes between members while roleplaying.

### 1.04.3 ARGUING

Arguing in public chats is hereby prohibited for any member of Venture Roleplay Gaming.&#x20;

Disputes are to be executed through direct message via Discord. Arguing&#x20;

with a staff member is also punishable.

### 1.05.0 CHAT REGULATIONS

There shall be no posting of pornographic/graphic violence/NSFW (content that is not suitable for work) content inside of the community chat platforms whatsoever. Content that is deemed as such will immediately be removed, and the producer of said content will be punished accordingly depending on the severity of the content posted. Whether or not content is deemed as such is purely up to a staff member’s discretion.&#x20;

### 1.05.1 FURTHER ELABORATION

Any member found to be breaking this rule will also be cited with breaking chapter 1, section 2, article 2. If you are unsure of whether or not your post is appropriate for chat, either do not post it at all, or consult a staff member.

### 1.06.0 IMPERSONATION

Any member of the community who pretends to be another member of the community will be punished accordingly. One shall not impersonate another staff member.&#x20;

Impersonating a staff member and/or founder/co-founder is highly punishable. Staff members have a very important job, and people impersonating them makes it harder for them to execute their job to the best of their ability. This rule protects players as well as the staff member’s innocence and credibility.

### 1.06.1 APPARATUSES

Members shall not drive vehicles related to their role for entertainment, or to mislead other members. All members are required to drive the vehicles permitted to them.

### 1.07.0 RANKS

No member of Venture Roleplay Gaming shall bug members of authority for a higher rank. Ranks are to be earned and/or trained for. Possible punishments for this offense are demotion (to what rank is up to a staff member’s discretion). Staff are also required to follow this rule.

### 1.07.1 OBTAINING RANKS

Ranks may and can only be obtained from training in a specific area, or are based on merit. Ranks are rewarded to exemplary members of the community. Asking for such ranks is taken as disrespect. All requests will be denied, and the requester will be punished upon making a second request.

### 1.07.2 STAFF RANKS

Members shall not request to be given a staff rank, they must apply. Upon completing the application process, their induction will be considered. One may not try to speed along this process. If any of these rules are broken, the player will be punished, and their application canceled.

### 1.08.0 HACKING/MOD MENUS

Outside clients within the community are not to be used at any time unless permitted for the sole purpose of roleplay. Only staff members may permit the use of a mod menu under the conditions that it would be used for a roleplay related affairs.

### 1.08.1 ACCEPTABLE USE

The only time outside mod menus/clients are permissible is when they serve to enhance the roleplay experience. All menus/clients must be presented before a staff member for inspection. If denied, the player may not use the provided add-ons. If approved, the player has permission to use the add-ons for that single day, unless told otherwise.

### 1.08.2 HACKS

Members found using exploits/hacks will instantly be punished. Hacks and exploits make the experience less enjoyable for other members, and ruin the game to a certain extent. Hacking shall not be tolerated at any time regardless of the scene/circumstances.

### 1.09.0 FAIL RP

Fail RP is when the player breaks character. This act is prohibited unless the circumstances are dire. Realism is stressed to a significant level within Venture Roleplay Gaming, and it is important that we keep up to standard. A member shall consistently be conducting roleplay as realistic as possible at all times. Failure to follow this rule will result in punishment at a staff member’s discretion.

### 1.09.1 REALISM

Venture Roleplay Gaming strives to enhance realism in gameplay. Fail RP would dismantle that effort, and ruin the roleplay experience. It is essential to stress the concept of realism at all times while playing.

### 1.09.2 DISCIPLINE

Fail RP is a serious, and very punishable offense. Members shall not unnecessarily break character publicly at any time, especially during a scene. Failure to keep character is highly punishable and considered a serious offense.

### 1.10.0 METAGAMING

Metagaming is the event in which a player uses outside knowledge in roleplay that their in-game player would not have known. This can cause unwanted mix-ups and plot twists. No member shall use outside knowledge that their player would not have known while engaging in roleplay.&#x20;

-   In-game footage must be provided for any sort of recorded evidence for any scene

### 1.11.0 STREAMING

In order to stream on this server, one must have permission to do so. The reason permission is required is because one must present the server at it’s best at all times when streaming. While someone is streaming, members shall go to greater efforts to avoid breaking the rules - especially Fail RP. While on is streaming, they are not to be disturbed whatsoever.&#x20;

### 1.11.1 FAIL RP&#x20;

Members streaming shall not fail RP at any time, and/or be around players who are not in character. Members streaming shall stay in character at all times, both publicly and on scene, until the stream has come to an end. All members are required to remain in character when being shown in a stream. Make sure all members know that you are streaming to avoid showing Fail RP.

### 1.11.2 REPRESENTATION&#x20;

Failure to represent the server positively will result in a revocation of streaming privileges. Members streaming must be on their best behavior until the stream has come to an end.

### 1.11.3 CENSORSHIP

Streamers are to try their best to avoid players who are breaking rules, such as failing RP, or breaking character. Streamers are only to show the best and most functional parts of the community whilst avoiding the lower levels of the server. Present the server as best as possible.

### 1.12.0 ABUSING PERMISSIONS

The server offers many functions that aid roleplay. However, these functions are not to be abused for the best interest in preserving the best interest of roleplay. One shall not impermissibly teleport or spawn in an unnecessary vehicle. Circumstances where teleportation is permissible are:&#x20;

-   When a member spawns too far from their center of operations&#x20;
-   When a member spawns on a mountain or farm that is too far from the nearest road

Teleportation is not to be used on stream.

### 1.12.1 TELEPORTING

Unnecessary teleporting is not permitted at any time unless given special instructions by a staff member. Players are to exhibit their best forms of realism at all times while playing on the server, and using the teleport option when it is unnecessary would dismantle that value. Teleporting is only permitted when the player is far from a road to drive, or they need to report to a duty station when they spawn in.

### 1.12.2 VEHICLE SPAWNING

Spawning an unnecessary amount of vehicles is never permitted within the community. Having a mass number of spawned vehicles that are not being used can cause the server to lag, and potentially crash. Members are only permitted to spawn in the vehicles necessary for roleplay.

### 1.13.0 COMMON SENSE POLICY

Although some things have not been covered to their full extent, it is up to the member to use common sense to determine whether or not an action is prohibited or not. This policy entrusts members with the ability to govern themselves to some extent, and it is considered a privilege. Over the course of the server’s uptime, more rules will be added due to experience.

### 1.13.1 RULE IMPLICATIONS&#x20;

If you are unsure of whether or not something is permitted, avoid doing it, or ask a staff member. Though these rules may seem very specific, they also hold certain implied values. It takes common sense to understand these implied values. Server rules will always be being tweaked/edited. If you feel something should be added, contact a member of the staff team.

##

## Chapter 2.00.0 - Courtesy Policy

### 2.00.0 COURTESY &#x20;

Courtesy is defined as: “the showing of politeness in one's attitude and behavior toward others.” This means that members shall behave and act with respect towards other members of the community. This includes being mature in voice chat (no unnecessary noises, yelling, screeches, etc…). This is an important policy to the server because it stresses the values of respect and maturity - two prominent values within this community.

### 2.01.0 NONCOMPLIANCE

If a member fails to demonstrate these presented values, they will be punished accordingly. They will also be placed on probation, just as if they broke any other rule. If the player fails to make a significant improvement with courtesy, their membership will be terminated.

##

## Chapter 3.00.0 - Necessary Action&#x20;

### 3.00.0 PUNISHMENTS &#x20;

Punishments are served as a result of a failure to follow previously presented rules and guidelines. They are served to create an example out of members who do not follow the rules, encourage the following of the rules, and to keep the server as friendly and functional as possible.

Staff will do their best to provide reasonable punishments. There is no exact set list of punishments exclusive to an offense. This means that most punishments given will be given on a staff member’s discretion. If you feel you have received an unreasonable punishment, contact another staff member and/or the head admin.&#x20;

### 3.00.1 PUNISHMENT DISCRETION

Punishments are to be given at staff’s discretion. Staff discretion allows the staff member to decide the severity of the punishment based on the severity of the offense. Punishments are left to staff discretion because most offenses are not of the same nature or severity. Less severe punishments come with less severe consequences and vice versa.&#x20;

### 3.01.0 APPEALS

If you believe you have changed after receiving punishment for breaking a rule, you may submit an appeal to lift said punishment. If your request is granted, you will be placed on a probationary period specific and unbeknownst to you. If you are punished again shortly after the approval of your appeal, you will be punished more severely, and/or not offered the option to appeal any longer.

### 3.00.1 APPEAL REGULATIONS

A member may only appeal once after being punished. No member shall send in multiple appeal applications. A member also only has one chance to appeal their punishment; meaning that if their punishment has already been lifted once, the member will no longer have the option to appeal their punishment.&#x20;

## Chapter 4.00.0 - Nickname

### 4.00.0 NAME FORMAT &#x20;

Player names are to be in the format First L. | Callsign . For example, `Jared S. | 1A-3`. Names are required to follow the first name and last initial format as shown. Failure to do so will result in staff confrontation. The player is required to have they’re name set this way in the server Discord, TeamSpeak, Server Website, and FiveM. (A player can change their name in FiveM by changing their Steam name, or modifying it within the FiveM Settings)

### 4.00.1 FORMAT NECESSITY

This specific format is required in order to keep name uniformity throughout the entire network. It makes it easier to identify a member when need be.

### 4.01.0 NAME RULES

Although a player has the power to change their name, they may not continuously&#x20;

change their name to avoid confrontation. There are logs in order to determine

past names of a player.&#x20;

### 4.01.1 FURTHER ELABORATION

Members shall not put the incorrect rank in their names, and must change the rank in their name upon rank change. Members must also keep names community friendly; meaning no racial slurs, or anything of that matter. Names also must be kept of reasonable length; preferably at a maximum of 15 characters (not including rank).

### 4.01.2 Name Colors & Blank Names

In game names must **not** include any colors under any circumstance. Player names must also not be blank and must include the name format as per [#4.00.0-name-format](./#4.00.0-name-format "mention")

##

## Chapter 5.00.0 - Player Reports

### 5.00.0 REPORTING A PLAYER &#x20;

If you feel a player and/or staff member is breaking the rules, do not hesitate to report them to their Chain of Command.

### 5.01.0 ABUSE OF REPORTS

Reporting players is to be taken seriously as their fate depends on it. Any abuse of this system will result in punishment, and a repeal of your credibility.&#x20;

### 5.01.1 REGULATION OF REPORTS

A player report form is a very serious piece of server documentation that is to be taken seriously at all times. No member shall jokingly fill out a report form on another player. Members are required to tell the full truth and provide proof of an offense taking place.&#x20;

### 5.01.2 DISCIPLINE

Members found misusing the reporting system will be punished severely. Player report forms are not to be misused/played with.
